GENERAL:
- add support for METplus confs for initialization 
  verification (have valid vs. init METplus conf files)
- write to jlogfile
- create list of environment variables
- comment through scripts
PRECIP_STEP1:
- use flxf files [MET needs to support Gaussian grids]
- implement continuous buckets/SUBTRACT method [METplus needs to support file naming in SUBTRACT so files don't override each other for multiple forecast hours]
